# snake_game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using turtle and random.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. 
   ```shell
   https://github.com/Omniasalman/snake_game
   
Use the arrow keys to control the snake: W, S, A, and D.

The objective is to eat the food (Random color and shapes) to grow the snake.

Avoid collisions with the boundaries of the game window and the snake's own body.

The game ends when the snake hits a boundary or collides with itself.

To quit the game, close the game window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.
